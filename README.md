# Fake News Detection using NLP and Machine Learning

---

# Project Overview

This project is a **Fake News Detection System** built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques.

The model predicts whether a news article or headline is **Fake News** or **Real News**.

The project uses:
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Logistic Regression
- Streamlit Web Application

Dataset used:
- Fake and Real News Dataset from Kaggle

# Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection.git
```

Move into project folder:

```bash
cd fake-news-detection
```

---

# Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv .env
```

Activate virtual environment:

## Windows

```bash
.env\Scripts\activate
```

## Linux / Mac

```bash
source .env/bin/activate
```

---

# Install Dependencies

# Dataset

Dataset Link:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset

Dataset contains:
- Fake.csv
- True.csv

# NLP Preprocessing Steps

The following preprocessing techniques were applied:

1. Lowercase conversion
2. Removal of special characters
3. Tokenization
4. Stopword removal
5. Stemming using PorterStemmer

Example:

Before preprocessing:

```text
Donald Trump Sends Out Embarrassing New Year Eve Message
```

After preprocessing:

```text
donald trump send embarrass new year eve messag
```

# Model Used

## Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is used as the primary machine learning model for binary text classification.

Advantages:
- Fast training
- High accuracy for text classification
- Efficient with TF-IDF features
- Lightweight and easy to deploy

# Streamlit App

The Streamlit web application allows users to:
- Enter a news headline or article
- Predict whether the news is fake or real
- View prediction instantly

---

# How to Run the Project

## 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk streamlit
```
